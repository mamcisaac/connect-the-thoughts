    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to the <strong>Connect-the-thoughts</strong>! Here's how you play:
        <ol>
            <li>Look at the words at the top of each column and the beginning of each row.</li>
            <li>Your goal is to place the given clues in the correct cells based on these words.</li>
            <li>Drag and drop each clue into the cell where you think it fits best.</li>
            <li>Click "Check Answers" to see if you are correct. You have three attempts per puzzle.</li>
            <li>If you get stuck, click "Reset" to try again with the current words, or "New Game" for a completely new set of words and clues.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
       <p>
        <strong>Column and Row Coloring:</strong><br>
        When you check your answers, the colors of the columns and rows will change based on correctness:
        <ul>
            <li><strong><span style="color:green;">Green:</span></strong> All answers in the row or column are correct.</li>
            <li><strong><span style="color:#C5B600;">Yellow:</span></strong> Some answers in the row or column are correct.</li>
            <li><strong><span style="color:red;">Red:</span></strong> No answers in the row or column are correct.</li>
        </ul>
        Use this feedback to adjust your answers!
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        If the column word is "Apple" and the row word is "Tree", a fitting clue might be "Fruit". Place "Fruit" in the cell where the "Apple" column and "Tree" row intersect.
